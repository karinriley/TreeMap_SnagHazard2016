# TreeMap_SnagHazard2016

# This repository contains scripts used to create and validate the TreeMap 2016,
# an imputed dataset of Forest Inventory Analysis plots at 30x30m resolution
# for forested pixels of the continental U.S.

# This repository also includes code for a derived data product, the Snag Hazard map.
# The Snag Hazard class (low, moderate, high, extreme) is based on density and
# median height of snags in the TreeMap 2016.
